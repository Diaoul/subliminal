Use `knowit` to extract information from video file, instead of `enzyme`:
frame rate, duration and subtitles.
`knowit` relies on external programs (`mediainfo`, `ffmpeg`, `mkvmerge`)
and falls back to using `enzyme` if none is installed.
On Windows and MacOS, `libmediainfo` is installed automatically
via the `pymediainfo` python package dependency.
On Linux, the `libmediainfo` or `mediainfo` package needs to be installed
with the package manager of your distribution.
