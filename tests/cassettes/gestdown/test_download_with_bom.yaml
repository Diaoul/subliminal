        --> 00:05:14,459\r\n- Sorry, ma'am, but this is a crime scene.\r\n- Oh, I
        can see that.\r\n\r\n101\r\n00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:16,900\r\nIt seems someone
        stole\r\nthis man's looks.\r\n\r\n102\r\n00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,739\r\nNice
        try, but the only crime here\r\n\r\n103\r\n00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:24,580\r\n-
        is that belt with those boots.\r\n- And the decapitation.\r\n\r\n104\r\n00:05:29,900
        --> 00:05:32,939\r\nAh, I forgot what it's like\r\nwatching you tear into
        a carcass.\r\n\r\n105\r\n00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:34,809\r\nJust one of the
        many perks\r\nof having a wife\r\n\r\n106\r\n00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:36,779\r\n-

        I'm more than just a woman\r\nwho was raised by bears.\r\n\r\n108\r\n00:05:38,980
        --> 00:05:41,519\r\nYou're right.\r\nThat was insensitive.\r\n\r\n109\r\n00:05:41,520
        --> 00:05:45,630\r\nUm, I was raised by bears, so I\r\nthink I'm tough enough
        to take it.\r\n\r\n110\r\n00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:48,100\r\nSo, anything you
        can\r\ntell me about the case?\r\n\r\n111\r\n00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,900\r\nIt's
        an active investigation.\r\nYou know I can't.\r\n\r\n112\r\n00:05:51,040 -->
        00:05:53,540\r\nJust like you can't ask\r\none question about\r\n\r\n113\r\n00:05:53,610

        --> 00:17:48,350\r\nI'm trying to be poetic here.\r\n\r\n329\r\n00:17:48,380
        --> 00:17:50,490\r\nDon't make me spell it out.\r\n\r\n330\r\n00:17:50,590
        --> 00:17:53,929\r\nBut I don't get what\r\nthis has to do with my son.\r\n\r\n331\r\n00:17:53,930
        --> 00:17:56,970\r\nSun, son...\r\n\r\n332\r\n00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:07,220\r\n-
        Wait, it's not the Chief.\r\n- It's the Chief!\r\n\r\n333\r\n00:18:09,320
        --> 00:18:11,210\r\nYou're under arrest\r\nfor the murders of two people\r\n\r\n334\r\n00:18:11,211
        --> 00:18:13,100\r\nwhose names I really\r\nshould have remembered.\r\n\r\n335\r\n00:18:13,200
        --> 00:18:14,499\r\nWhy would I do this?\r\n\r\n336\r\n00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:18,979\r\n-
        I have no motive.\r\n- I got your motive right here.\r\n\r\n337\r\n00:18:18,980
        --> 00:18:23,420\r\n- Case closed.\r\n- That's not what motive means.\r\n\r\n338\r\n00:18:23,520
        --> 00:18:25,660\r\nBut it...\r\nit does the matchy thing.\r\n\r\n339\r\n00:18:25,760
        --> 00:18:27,790\r\nChief's innocent.\r\nThe notepad isn't hers.\r\n\r\n340\r\n00:18:27,930
        --> 00:18:30,269\r\nShe doesn't believe\r\nin climate change,\r\n\r\n341\r\n00:18:30,270
        --> 00:18:32,400\r\ntherefore she'd never buy recycled.\r\n\r\n342\r\n00:18:32,440
        --> 00:18:35,305\r\nDuh! It's a scam.\r\nThey want us to pay\r\n\r\n343\r\n00:18:35,306
        --> 00:18:37,880\r\nmore for something\r\nthat's already been used?\r\n\r\n344\r\n00:18:38,010
        --> 00:18:41,250\r\n- Pff, right.\r\n- So if it's not the Chief, then who?\r\n\r\n345\r\n00:18:41,350
        --> 00:18:43,420\r\nThe poor little boy in her shadow.\r\n\r\n346\r\n00:18:45,960
        --> 00:18:48,200\r\nYou wanted to be a detective,\r\nbut your mom never let
        you.\r\n\r\n347\r\n00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:50,610\r\nSo you planted a flute\r\nin
        that poor kid's butt,\r\n\r\n348\r\n00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:52,870\r\nknowing
        I'd put the pieces\r\ntogether and nail the Chief.\r\n\r\n349\r\n00:18:52,894
        --> 00:18:55,480\r\nAnd then, when she's no longer\r\nblocking out the sun,\r\n\r\n350\r\n00:18:55,580
        --> 00:18:57,549\r\nthen you, her son,\r\ndifferent spelling,\r\n\r\n351\r\n00:18:57,550
        --> 00:19:00,260\r\nget to be a detective at last.\r\n\r\n352\r\n00:19:00,330
        --> 00:19:06,840\r\n- Uh, yeah, pretty much exactly.\r\n- So where is Abigail?\r\n\r\n353\r\n00:19:15,190
        --> 00:19:16,640\r\nHi!\r\n\r\n354\r\n00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:30,750\r\nMy
        tanks...\r\n\r\n355\r\n00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:34,730\r\nto Flute, for saving
        my daughter.\r\n\r\n356\r\n00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:37,030\r\nI got something\r\nthat
        belongs to you.\r\n\r\n357\r\n00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:41,340\r\nBadgey! Wait,
        first,\r\nthere's somebody I need to see.\r\n\r\n358\r\n00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:49,719\r\nHarm,
        you were right, we can't\r\npick up where we left off.\r\n\r\n359\r\n00:19:49,720
        --> 00:19:53,500\r\nBut maybe we can start\r\nwhere we are right now.\r\n\r\n360\r\n00:19:53,600
        --> 00:19:55,740\r\nI just want to give my son\r\neverything he needs.\r\n\r\n361\r\n00:19:55,770
        --> 00:19:59,010\r\nAnd I guess that includes you.\r\n\r\n362\r\n00:19:59,040
        --> 00:20:01,080\r\nI learned a vital lesson\r\ntoday, child person.\r\n\r\n363\r\n00:20:01,150
        --> 00:20:05,790\r\nThe only one I need to prove\r\nI've changed to is you.\r\n\r\n364\r\n00:20:05,890
        --> 00:20:08,090\r\nOtherwise, you'll turn into\r\na twisted sicko like Stewart\r\n\r\n365\r\n00:20:08,114
        --> 00:20:10,200\r\nand frame me for a murder\r\nI didn't commit.\r\n\r\n366\r\n00:20:10,230
        --> 00:20:13,469\r\n- May I?\r\n- You may.\r\n\r\n367\r\n00:20:21,750 -->
        00:20:24,190\r\nGrimsburg, I promised\r\nmyself I'd never come back,\r\n\r\n368\r\n00:20:24,230
        --> 00:20:26,900\r\nand yet somehow, it's this\r\nplace where I feel like
        maybe,\r\n\r\n369\r\n00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:29,000\r\njust maybe,\r\nI'll
        solve the one mystery\r\n\r\n370\r\n00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:32,040\r\nI've
        never been able to crack... myself.\r\n\r\n371\r\n00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,980\r\nOh,
        and the mystery of where\r\nI put my suede desert boots.\r\n\r\n372\r\n00:20:35,080
        --> 00:20:37,920\r\nAnd if there's time, maybe how\r\nto use the self-checkout
        lane.\r\n\r\n373\r\n00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:40,282\r\nI've literally never
        done it\r\nwithout the person having to\r\n\r\n374\r\n00:20:40,283 --> 00:20:42,614\r\ncome
        over, and at that point,\r\nwhy can't they just check me out?\r\n\r\n375\r\n00:20:42,630
        --> 00:20:44,080\r\nWow, this is a pretty cool shot.\r\n\r\n376\r\n00:20:44,100
        --> 00:20:46,381\r\nIt seems like they're putting\r\nsome real money behind
        this.\r\n\r\n377\r\n00:20:46,405 --> 00:20:49,422\r\nThat's got to be a good
        sign.\r\n\r\n378\r\n00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:55,560\r\nSo your pop's moving\r\ninto
        the basement, hmm?\r\n\r\n379\r\n00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:57,560\r\nTogether
        under one roof again.\r\n\r\n380\r\n00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:00,699\r\n- This
        is what we've been dreaming of!\r\n- Speak for yourself.\r\n\r\n381\r\n00:21:00,700
        --> 00:21:02,699\r\nI've been dreaming about\r\nmeeting Phoebe Bridgers.\r\n\r\n382\r\n00:21:02,700
        --> 00:21:04,809\r\nAll we need now is a little nudge\r\n\r\n383\r\n00:21:04,810
        --> 00:21:07,450\r\nto get them\r\nall the way back together.\r\n\r\n384\r\n00:21:07,480
        --> 00:21:11,050\r\nEasy. You flood the basement.\r\nWhen your dad starts
        to drown,\r\n\r\n385\r\n00:21:11,090 --> 00:21:14,290\r\nyour mom is forced
        to save him\r\nand they're back in love.\r\n\r\n386\r\n00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:18,430\r\nOr
        you all drown there, and become\r\na big happy family in heaven.\r\n\r\n387\r\n00:21:18,470
        --> 00:21:21,669\r\nOr, I give them love letters I wrote\r\n\r\n388\r\n00:21:21,670
        --> 00:21:24,850\r\n- and say they're from the other person.\r\n- Eh, that
        works too.\r\n\r\n389\r\n00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:28,205\r\nBut if you do go
        with that one,\r\nyou probably want to shut off\r\n\r\n390\r\n00:21:28,206
        --> 00:21:31,858\r\nthe main water valve, like right now.\r\n\r\n391\r\n00:21:33,115
