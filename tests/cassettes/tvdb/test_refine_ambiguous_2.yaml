        living in caveman days. Unlike previous television series and almost the entire

        throughout the episodes, to allow more interaction with other characters.
        Voiced by Matt Frewer, he was given a humorous American accent in order to
        appeal to younger children, which was in sharp contrast to the sophisticated
        British accent supplied by impressionist Rich Little who voiced the Panther
