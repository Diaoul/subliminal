Installation
============

From Pypi
---------

For a better isolation with your system you should use a dedicated virtualenv.
The preferred installation method is to use `pipx <https://github.com/pypa/pipx>`_ that does that for you::

    $ pipx install subliminal

Subliminal can be also be installed as a regular python module by running::

    $ pip install --user subliminal

From source
-----------

If you want to modify the code, `fork <https://github.com/Diaoul/subliminal/fork>`_ this repo,
clone your fork locally and install a development version::

    $ git clone https://github.com/<my-username>/subliminal
    $ cd subliminal
    $ pip install --user -e '.[dev,test,docs]'

External dependencies
---------------------

To extract information about the video files, `subliminal` uses `knowit <https://github.com/ratoaq2/knowit`.
For better results, make sure one of its provider is installed, for instance `MediaInfo <https://mediaarea.net/en/MediaInfo>`.
