        you are not going\r\n\r\n130\r\n00:05:16,577 --> 00:05:18,427\r\nto come out
        of\r\nthis looking good.\r\n\r\n131\r\n00:05:18,429 --> 00:05:19,662\r\nSheldon,\r\nI
        don't understand.\r\n\r\n132\r\n00:05:19,664 --> 00:05:21,580\r\nI thought
        you said\r\nyou were fine with it.\r\n\r\n133\r\n00:05:21,582 --> 00:05:22,698\r\nWell,
        I was.\r\n\r\n134\r\n00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:24,333\r\nBut that was before\r\nHoward
        explained to me\r\n\r\n135\r\n00:05:24,335 --> 00:05:26,469\r\nhow awful it
        would be\r\nif he had to work\r\n\r\n136\r\n00:05:26,471 --> 00:05:28,137\r\nwith
        his significant other.\r\n\r\n137\r\n00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:30,723\r\nHe said
        what?\r\n\r\n138\r\n00:05:30,725 --> 00:05:32,675\r\nNow, don't be insulted.\r\n\r\n139\r\n00:05:32,677
        --> 00:05:36,896\r\nHe just thinks too much of you\r\nwould be mind-numbingly
        tedious.\r\n\r\n140\r\n00:05:36,898 --> 00:05:40,066\r\nExcuse me, I need
        to have\r\na chat with my husband.\r\n\r\n141\r\n00:05:40,068 --> 00:05:41,901\r\nYeah,
        well, now,\r\nwell... keep it short.\r\n\r\n142\r\n00:05:41,903 --> 00:05:45,438\r\nFr-From
        what I gather,\r\nbrevity is your friend.\r\n\r\n143\r\n00:05:46,573 --> 00:05:48,741\r\nSo,
        are we good here?\r\n\r\n144\r\n00:05:48,743 --> 00:05:50,326\r\nNo, we're
        not good here.\r\n\r\n145\r\n00:05:50,328 --> 00:05:51,827\r\nI am working
        on this project.\r\n\r\n146\r\n00:05:51,829 --> 00:05:54,080\r\nYeah, and
        you can't tell her\r\nwhat she can and cannot do.\r\n\r\n147\r\n00:05:54,082
        --> 00:05:56,098\r\nLast week, you told Leonard\r\nhe couldn't wear\r\n\r\n148\r\n00:05:56,100

        --> 00:06:08,878\r\nI'll be in a different building.\r\n\r\n154\r\n00:06:08,880
        --> 00:06:10,746\r\nAnd we don't even have\r\nto have lunch together.\r\n\r\n155\r\n00:06:10,748
        --> 00:06:11,864\r\nReally?\r\n\r\n156\r\n00:06:11,866 --> 00:06:14,517\r\nYes.
        Before all things,\r\nI'm a scientist.\r\n\r\n157\r\n00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:16,969\r\nI'm
        just there to do my work\r\nand, with a little luck,\r\n\r\n158\r\n00:06:16,971

        sure your mothlike\r\npersonality won't be drawn\r\n\r\n161\r\n00:06:25,813
        --> 00:06:28,564\r\nto this blazing fire\r\nthat is myself?\r\n\r\n162\r\n00:06:31,535
        --> 00:06:33,786\r\nMore and more sure.\r\n\r\n163\r\n00:06:33,788 --> 00:06:36,872\r\nWell,
        then, you\r\nhave my permission.\r\n\r\n164\r\n00:06:36,874 --> 00:06:37,957\r\nI
        didn't ask\r\nfor your permission.\r\n\r\n165\r\n00:06:37,959 --> 00:06:39,158\r\nToo
        late. No backsies.\r\n\r\n166\r\n00:06:41,611 --> 00:06:44,413\r\nNo, no,
        listen to me.\r\nSheldon misunderstood.\r\n\r\n167\r\n00:06:44,415 --> 00:06:45,381\r\nWhat
        I meant was,\r\n\r\n168\r\n00:06:45,383 --> 00:06:46,448\r\nif we worked together,\r\n\r\n169\r\n00:06:46,450
        --> 00:06:48,117\r\nthere'd be too much\r\nof me for you,\r\n\r\n170\r\n00:06:48,119
        --> 00:06:50,252\r\nnot the other way around.\r\n\r\n171\r\n00:06:50,254 -->
        00:06:52,722\r\nHoward, if you're going\r\nto lie to your wife,\r\n\r\n172\r\n00:06:52,724
        --> 00:06:55,324\r\ndon't start the sentence\r\nwith \"Sheldon misunderstood.\"\r\n\r\n173\r\n00:06:56,877
        --> 00:06:58,010\r\nThat's a dead giveaway.\r\n\r\n174\r\n00:06:58,012 -->
        00:06:59,929\r\nWell?\r\n\r\n175\r\n00:06:59,931 --> 00:07:01,130\r\nOkay,
        fine.\r\n\r\n176\r\n00:07:01,132 --> 00:07:02,898\r\nI did say that,\r\nand
        I think it's true.\r\n\r\n177\r\n00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:05,017\r\nI think
        if we worked together\r\nand lived together,\r\n\r\n178\r\n00:07:05,019 -->
        00:07:06,519\r\nwe'd get sick of each other.\r\n\r\n179\r\n00:07:06,521 -->
        00:07:08,104\r\nYeah, but to be fair,\r\nhe only said the part\r\n\r\n180\r\n00:07:08,106
        --> 00:07:09,188\r\nabout him\r\ngetting sick of you.\r\n\r\n181\r\n00:07:09,190
        --> 00:07:11,023\r\nFor the love of God, why?!\r\n\r\n182\r\n00:07:15,212
        --> 00:07:17,863\r\nWhat exactly do you\r\nthink you'd get sick of?\r\n\r\n183\r\n00:07:17,865
        --> 00:07:20,015\r\nHis only options here\r\nare to fake a heart attack\r\n\r\n184\r\n00:07:20,017
        --> 00:07:22,384\r\nor have a real one.\r\n\r\n185\r\n00:07:22,386 --> 00:07:25,654\r\nIt-it's
        nothing\r\nin particular. I...\r\n\r\n186\r\n00:07:25,656 --> 00:07:27,823\r\nIs
        it my voice?\r\nAm I too bossy?\r\n\r\n187\r\n00:07:27,825 --> 00:07:28,958\r\nWhat...?\r\n\r\n188\r\n00:07:28,960
        --> 00:07:31,877\r\nMy arm is feeling numb.\r\n\r\n189\r\n00:07:32,796 -->
        00:07:35,781\r\nNailed it.\r\n\r\n190\r\n00:07:35,783 --> 00:07:39,385\r\nThat's
        the wrong arm for\r\na heart attack, doofus.\r\n\r\n191\r\n00:07:41,221 -->
        00:07:44,356\r\nMy point is, I'm sure\r\nthere are things about me\r\n\r\n192\r\n00:07:44,358
        --> 00:07:46,642\r\nthat would drive you crazy\r\nif you had to deal\r\n\r\n193\r\n00:07:46,644
        --> 00:07:48,394\r\nwith them all day long.\r\n\r\n194\r\n00:07:48,396 -->

        --> 00:07:55,401\r\nWhere am I supposed to\r\nlook when I lie to you?\r\n\r\n197\r\n00:07:55,403
        --> 00:07:57,753\r\nFind somewhere else \r\nto sleep tonight.\r\n\r\n198\r\n00:07:57,755
        --> 00:07:59,905\r\nOh, Bernie...\r\n\r\n199\r\n00:08:06,863 --> 00:08:10,466\r\nIf
        it makes you feel any better,\r\nAmy and I are fine.\r\n\r\n200\r\n00:08:13,069

        --> 00:08:25,931\r\nIt wasn't a pajama party.\r\n\r\n204\r\n00:08:25,933 -->
        00:08:28,434\r\nIt was just a couple of bros\r\nhanging out, giggling,\r\n\r\n205\r\n00:08:28,436
        --> 00:08:31,520\r\neating cookie dough\r\nand watching <i>Princess Bride.</i>\r\n\r\n206\r\n00:08:33,073

        Sheldon,\r\nnone of this would've happened\r\n\r\n209\r\n00:08:44,735 -->
        00:08:46,202\r\nif I hadn't tried\r\nto help you.\r\n\r\n210\r\n00:08:46,204
        --> 00:08:48,787\r\nUh, it also wouldn't\r\nhave happened\r\n\r\n211\r\n00:08:48,789
        --> 00:08:50,289\r\nif, in the early universe,\r\n\r\n212\r\n00:08:50,291
        --> 00:08:53,792\r\nhydrogen was a little more\r\ncommon or a little less
        common.\r\n\r\n213\r\n00:08:53,794 --> 00:08:56,278\r\nThis is fun. Your turn.\r\n\r\n214\r\n00:08:57,264

        you make\r\na good point.\r\n\r\n225\r\n00:09:18,452 --> 00:09:20,653\r\nIt
        would appear\r\nI was worried for nothing.\r\n\r\n226\r\n00:09:20,655 -->
        00:09:22,204\r\nLook at her, desperately wishing\r\n\r\n227\r\n00:09:22,206

        --> 00:09:41,840\r\nI-I don't know.\r\nSounds kind of heavy.\r\n\r\n235\r\n00:09:41,842
        --> 00:09:44,810\r\nThat's 'cause you always\r\nfill up on chips.\r\n\r\n236\r\n00:09:44,812
        --> 00:09:47,479\r\nAnd this is Dr. Gunderson\r\nfrom Stockholm.\r\n\r\n237\r\n00:09:47,481

        the Nordic reputation for\r\nlack of humor is well-founded.\r\n\r\n241\r\n00:10:02,812

        put up with your nonsense.\r\n\r\n417\r\n00:18:06,981 --> 00:18:09,583\r\nNot
