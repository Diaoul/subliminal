        \n\r\n167\r\n00:06:44,415 --> 00:06:45,381\r\nWhat I meant was,\r\n\r\n168\r\
        \n00:06:45,383 --> 00:06:46,448\r\nif we worked together,\r\n\r\n169\r\n00:06:46,450\

        Well?\r\n\r\n175\r\n00:06:59,931 --> 00:07:01,130\r\nOkay, fine.\r\n\r\n176\r\
        \n00:07:01,132 --> 00:07:02,898\r\nI did say that,\r\nand I think it's true.\r\
        \n\r\n177\r\n00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:05,017\r\nI think if we worked together\r\
